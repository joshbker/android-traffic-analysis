# DT4003 Maths for Data Science Assessment

## Overview
- **Module**: DT4003 Maths for Data Science
- **Submission Deadline**: May 19th, 2025, 3pm
- **Assessment Weight**: 100% Coursework (Individual portfolio, 2,000 words or equivalent)

## Assignment Context
You are hired as a data scientist by AndroiHypo (a telecommunications company) to investigate, analyze, and draw conclusions from a dataset related to Android malware detection. The company proposes using network layer features as the foundation for machine learning models to detect malware applications.

## Research Hypotheses
AndroiHypo has proposed two hypotheses:
1. The **probability** of having benign traffic **given** the DNS query times is more than 5 times **and** the number of TCP packets is more than 40, is **at least 9%**.
2. There is a massive traffic volume bytes difference between benign and malicious traffic types.

## Assignment Requirements

### 1. Dataset Analysis and Pre-Processing (25%)
- Explanation and analysis of the provided dataset
- List of problems encountered when manipulating the dataset
- Description of steps taken to clean the dataset

### 2. Dataset Visualization and Proposed Hypotheses (25%)
- Discussion related to the hypotheses using at least two different types of graphs (e.g., boxplot, scatter plots, histogram)

### 3. Hypothesis Testing (30%)
- Analysis and evaluation of the hypotheses applying statistical tests to support your arguments

### 4. References (10%)
- List of references using the Harvard referencing format

### 5. Appendix (10%)
- Python code demonstrating actual use of the language in solution implementation

## Marking Scheme

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Dataset Analysis and Pre-Processing | 25% |
| Dataset Visualization and proposed hypotheses | 25% |
| Hypothesis testing | 30% |
| References | 10% |
| Coding - correctness | 10% |

### Grade Boundaries

| Mark | Grade | Characteristics |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 0 | Fail | Plagiarism, collusion, non-presentation, name only |
| 1-39 | Reassess | Project not working or extremely limited scope; Inadequate report with no demonstration or references |
| 40-49 | 3rd, D (Pass) | Project works but has limited scope; Report meets basic requirements; Inadequate references |
| 50-59 | 2ii, C (Satisfactory) | Complete project with considerable application; Coherent report with some self-criticism; Sufficient demonstration of functionality; Evidence of references |
| 60-69 | 2i, B (Good) | Fully functional project with advanced application; Good report with reflection and evaluation; Well-explained demonstration; Good quality academic references |
| 70-100 | 1st class, A (Excellent) | Fully functional, innovative project with advanced complexity; Excellent report with elegance and innovation; Well-presented demonstration explaining all concepts; Excellent quality academic references with critical analysis |

### Assessment Criteria Scale
Each section is assessed on a scale from 0% to 100%:
- **0%**: No evidence has been provided
- **30%**: No understanding, inadequate, factual but little interpretation
- **40%**: Adequate response, basic knowledge, clear intention
- **50%**: Good response, satisfactory analysis and judgment
- **60%**: Evaluates information, good ability to state and defend position
- **75%**: Strong ability to state and defend position, uses criteria in judgments
- **100%**: Authoritative, superlative, creative
